% \section*{Tips for Report Writing}
% \textbf{REMOVE THIS SECTION BEFORE SUBMITTING THE REPORT.}\\

% \noindent \textit{The target audience has exactly the same skills as the author,
% except they do not know anything at all about the specific application described
% in the report.} \\

% Consider the following:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{The report must be \textit{centered around the requirements}.
%   Which are they (Introduction), how did you work to meet them (Method), what is
%   the solution that meets them (Result), and how can you be sure they are met
%   (Discussion). This is the IMRaD method.} The requirements on the Introduction,
%   Method, Result and Discussion chapters are described below under each chapter.

%   \item Is spelling and grammar correct? Is spoken language avoided?

%   \item Does the report have a good structure with sections, subsections and
%   paragraphs?

%   \item Is the text clarified with images and/or other figures, and with links
%   to the code in your Git repository? Remember that all figures (images, tables,
%   graphs, code listings, etc) shall be numbered and have a short explaining
%   text.
% \end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

% \textbf{This chapter tells \textit{what} are you going to do.} 

% Explain the task and the requirements on the solution. It's important to clearly
% state the requirements. \textit{Also specify which other student you worked with
% when solving the tasks, or if you worked alone.} 

\section{Literature Study}
% This chapter must prove that you collected sufficient knowledge before starting
% development, instead of just hacking away without knowing how to complete a
% task. State what you have read and briefly summarize what you have learned.

\clearpage
\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
% \textbf{This chapter tells \textit{how} you solved the task.}
% Explain how you worked when solving the tasks and how you evaluated that your
% solution met the requirements. \textit{Do not explain your solution and do not
% refer to code}, that belongs to the \textit{Result} chapter. More specific
% instructions for the content can be found under each task on the Project page in
% Canvas.


\subsection*{Tools}
The modeling tool used was \emph{PlantUML}.
PlantUML is an open-source tool for creating diagrams using a text-based
syntax.
It was chosen to enable version control through git and to avoid using a
proprietary graphical editor.
This report was also written in plain text mode -- \LaTeX.

All code was written in \emph{Visual Studio Code}.
Quick-fixes and editing was, however, done in \emph{Vim}.

\subsection*{The overall Work-flow}

\pagebreak
\section{Result}

% \textbf{This chapter explains \textit{the result} of what you did.}

% \textbf{The report must show that you have done the work yourself and that you
% have understood what you have done}, both of these goals are met by carefully
% explaining your solution here in the result chapter, and proving that it meets
% the requirements. \textit{State each requirement that is met} and explain
% \textit{how you met it}. Also include links to your code in your Git
% repository, and include also diagrams, see Figure \ref{fig:diag}, and other
% figures to illustrate your reasoning. All figures must be referenced in the
% text. Ask yourself if the solution is clearly explained, and if the reader
% will understand the application. What would you yourself want to know if you
% read about the application, is that included in the report? More specific
% instructions for the content can be found under each task on the Project page
% in Canvas.

% The naming convention is based on 
% Mozilla's SQL Style Guide. 

% Therefore, \emph{Snake Case}
% (sometimes referred to as underscore case or 
%  snake\_case)
% is used, where each space is replaced with an underscore
% and all letters, including the first letter, is written in lowercase.

% \end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

% \textbf{This chapter \textit{analysis} the result presented in the previous section.} 

% Evaluate your solution according to the assessment criteria found in the assessment-criteria documents, which are found under the bullet \textit{In the Discussion chapter of your report...}, under each task on the Project page in Canvas. You do not have to cover all specified criteria.
